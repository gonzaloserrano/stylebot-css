 [Stylebot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha?hl=en) is a Chrome extension that allows you to persist CSS modifications per site.

I backup in this repository some tweaks that are useful to me:

  * **trello** ([screenshot](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16897247/trello.png))
    * tweak the first 7 columns as week days so you can have a TODO list for the current week.
    * the 8th column is the backlog
    * the first column should be the current day, if a day passes you move its tasks to another day or to the backlog
    * the last column is the weekly tasks list and its placed on the bottom
    * supports CSS counters so everything labeled as green is considered done, other label colors are for “todo do”.
  * **google calendar**: events that do not fill the whole day are displayed lighter and the time is not coloured ([screenshot](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16897247/calendar.png))
  * **feedly**: remove lots of useless padding in the floating view.
